# Task
Your task is to create a script for the shell that you are using (bash) and name
it “mycrontab”, which will act as a friendly interface for the user who wants
to use the “crontab” command, through choices that he can have using a
carefully designed menu. By using this script, the user should be able to
check what tasks run periodically and when, add new tasks, edit a task,
delete an existing task or delete all tasks in the list. You should take into
consideration that the user is not able to understand the structure of the
“crontab” file so it is up to you to help the user understand the information of
the “crontab” file, by offering a friendly human readable terminal interface.
